# Created and Last Modified

Parses a series of ROR data dump files to determine when a specific record was first created and the last date it was modified. Use in combination with https://github.com/ror-community/curation_ops/blob/v2-crosswalk/v2_crosswalk/update_dates_v2.py to add created and last modified dates to records in a v2 data dump that was generated by crosswalking from a v1 data dump.

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- Files to be processed should have a date in their filename in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## How to Use:

### Arguments:
- `-d`, `--dump_directory`: Path to a directory that contains ROR dump files to extract dates from. Typically, this is the path to a local copy of the [ror-data repo](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-data). Defaults to `../../ror-data`


### Execution:

Run the script by using the following command:
```bash
python created_last_modified.py -d /Users/user/git/ror-data
```

The output is a CSV located in the same directory as the script with the filename `[MOST RECENT DUMP FILE NAME]_created_last_mod.csv`, ex `v1.33-2023-09-21-ror-data_created_last_mod.csv`.
