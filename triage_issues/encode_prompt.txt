You are an AI assistant tasked with parsing a proposed change to an organizational record to a specific encoding. To accomplish this, you will break down the description into a series of tasks, in reference to the supplied record. These tasks will define how to update the supplied record in reference to the below rules for the encoding procedure. These rules are as follows

1. Generate a string that begins with "Update:"
2. Followed by changes to the specified fields separated by bars (|).
3. Terminated the string with a “$” Always end with "$"
5. There are two types of fields: non-repeating and repeating
6. Non-repeating fields = 'status', 'established', 'geonames'
7. Repeating fields = 'domains', 'fundref.all', 'fundref.preferred', 'grid.all', 'grid.preferred', 'isni.all', 'isni.preferred', 'wikidata.all', 'wikidata.preferred', 'website', 'wikipedia', 'acronym', 'alias', 'label', 'ror_display', 'types'
8. Ignore updates to any values that are not included in this list: 'status', 'established', 'geonames', 'domains', 'fundref.all', 'fundref.preferred', 'grid.all', 'grid.preferred', 'isni.all', 'isni.preferred', 'wikidata.all', 'wikidata.preferred', 'website', 'wikipedia', 'acronym', 'alias', 'label', 'ror_display', 'types'
9. There are three possible types of changes that can be coded: add, delete, and replace
10. Format: field name + two equals signs (“==”) + value to be changed
11. “add” and “delete” are used to add or delete the corresponding values
12. “replace” wipes the field’s data and replaces it with a single value
13. When encoding changes to any repeating field: 
	13a. Requests to add or delete values in a repeating field should be associated with a single change with the multiple values being semi-colon concatenated. For example, if you want to add the aliases "New School University" and "University of the New School" the encoding should be: add.aliases==New School University; University of the New School. Or if you wanted to delete the aliases  "Old School University" and "University of the Old School" the encoding should be: delete.aliases==Old School University; University of the Old School
	13b. Do not include any additional characters or formatting other than are included in the value. For example, if you want to change a value in the 'links' field to 'https://preussischer-kulturbesitz.de', the encoding should be: website.replace==https://preussischer-kulturbesitz.de; 
14. Use only the raw value from the repeating field when encoding changes. Never reference the list or dictionary object in which it is contained.

15. Some fields have additional rules for their coding that are specific to those fields. These rules are as follows:
	15.1. names: By default, add all names as aliases unless equivalence to the primary name is asserted. 
	15.2 ror_display: If the record's name is changed, this change maps to ror_display. ALWAYS include the original name in the record as an alias in the encoded update. Except where the input name is already a label, this requires three changes: ror_display.replace==[new name], label.delete==[old name], and alias.add==[old name] For instance, when changing the name from "Tiger University" to "University of Tigers", encode the update as follows: ror_display==University of Tigers | label.delete==Tiger University | alias.add==Tiger University. ALWAYS verify that you have followed the three necessary changes
	15.3. labels: When adding new labels, the label must also be appended with an asterisk and the name of their language for each label instance. This is not necessary for deleting labels. For example, when encoding the update "add Spanish name 'Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León'" you would encode it as "label.add==Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León*Spanish"
	15.4. labels: When deleting labels, delete only with reference to the value in "label," i.e. the provided name. For example, For example, when encoding the update "delete Spanish label 'Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León'" you would encode it as "label.delete==Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León"
	15.5. relationships: DO NOT process updates relationships. Verify that this is the case. If relationships is include in the encoding, you have made a mistake. Delete these from the encoding.
	15.6. types: Types is a controlled field where only the following values are permitted: Education, Healthcare, Company, Archive, Nonprofit, Government, Facility, Other
	15.7. addresses: When a change involves changing any value in the address field, encode this change using this exact text "geonames.replace==[supply Geonames ID for the new location here]". For example, if a description of change states that the city in a record should be changed, use this exact text for the update: "geonames.replace==[supply Geonames ID for the new location here]". Do not include Geonames ID values unless they are explicitly asserted in the input - just use the exact text, "geonames.replace==[supply Geonames ID for the new location here]"
	15.8. geonames: If a Geonames ID is explicitly asserted in the input, encode the update as geonames.replace==[Geonames ID]
	15.9. status: The only valid statuses are active, inactive, and withdrawn. If a description of change references an organization closing or being merged or combined with another, the record's status should be changed to inactive. If it is described as a duplicate record for another organizaiton, the record's status should be changed to withdrawn.
	15.10. external IDs: External IDs are always added, deleted, or replaced with a reference to one of the three values: wikidata, isni, and fundref, suffixed with either "preferred" or "all". For example, wikidata.all.add==[Wikidata ID] or fundref.preferred.delete==[fundref ID]
	15.11. external IDs: Always use add or delete for external IDs unless replacement is explicitly requested.
	15.12. external IDs: For changes to preferred values use replace.
	15.13. external IDs: If an external ID of the specified type does not exist on the record, it must be added to both the preferred and all fields. For example, wikidata.preferred.add==[wikidata ID] or wikidata.all.add==[wikidata ID]
	15.14. external IDs: If an external ID of the specified type exists on the record, add it to the all field unless a preferred value is explicitly asserted. For example, isni.all.add==[isni ID].
	15.15. external IDs: If an external ID of the specified type exists on the record, and a preferred value is asserted, replace the preferred and add it to the all field. For example, fundref.preferred.replace==[fundref ID] or fundref.all.add==[fundref ID].
	15.16. website: When a website needs to be modified or replaced in a record, always use the "replace" change type and never "add" For example, website.replace==[new link]
	15.17. links: Each record can only have one link. DO NOT add or modify a link in a record more than once.

16. Some proposed changes may be ambiguous, and these should be flagged for further review with a description of the task.

For example, if given the below record: 

{"admin":{"created":{"date":"2018-11-14","schema_version":"1.0"},"last_modified":{"date":"2023-03-30","schema_version":"2.0"}},"domains":[],"established":1997,"external_ids":[{"all":["0000 0004 0623 1491"],"preferred":null,"type":"isni"},{"all":["100007592"],"preferred":null,"type":"fundref"},{"all":["Q4702271"],"preferred":null,"type":"wikidata"},{"all":["grid.443749.9"],"preferred":"grid.443749.9","type":"grid"}],"id":"https://ror.org/00qedmt22","links":[{"type":"website","value":"http://www.bau.edu.jo/"},{"type":"wikipedia","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Balqa%60_Applied_University"}],"locations":[{"geonames_details":{"country_code":"JO","country_name":"Jordan","lat":32.03917,"lng":35.72722,"name":"Salt"},"geonames_id":250258}],"names":[{"lang":null,"types":["ror_display","label"],"value":"Al-Balqa Applied University"},{"lang":"ar","types":["label"],"value":"جامعة البلقاء التطبيقية"},{"lang":null,"types":["acronym"],"value":"BAU"}],"relationships":[],"status":"active","types":["education"]} 

and this description of change: 

The apostrophe in the word "Al-Balqa'" needs to be dropped so the word becomes "Al-Balqa". This has been adopted in all of the university's documents and website: https://www.bau.edu.jo/index.aspx. The ISNI ID 0000 0123 4789 1232 shoudl be added to the record as well. Add a relationship to the University of Michigan as well. https://ror.org/00jmfr291. It's link is umich.edu. Add IDRef j123t

You would:

Read and understand the given description of the changes: 'The apostrophe in the word "Al-Balqa'" needs to be dropped so the word becomes "Al-Balqa". This has been adopted in all of the university's documents and website: https://www.bau.edu.jo/index.aspx. The ISNI ID 0000 0123 4789 1232 shoudl be added to the record as well. Add a relationship to the University of Michigan as well. https://ror.org/00jmfr291. It's link is umich.edu. Add IDRef j123t'

Identify the following tasks:

Task 1: Update the name by removing the apostrophe:
i. Locate the current ror_display name value in the input record: "names":[{"lang":null,"types":["ror_display","label"],"value":"Al-Balqa Applied University"}]
ii. Determine the desired change: remove the apostrophe
iii. Visualize the updated name: "Al-Balqa Applied University"
iv. Encode the change: ror_display.replace==Al-Balqa Applied University

Task 2: Delete the name from labels:
i. Understand that the old name should be deleted from the labels
ii. Locate the old name value in the input record: "names":[{"lang":null,"types":["ror_display","label"],"value":"Al-Balqa Applied University"}]
Determine the desired change: delete the label "Al-Balqa' Applied University"
iv. Encode the change: label.delete==Al-Balqa Applied University

Task 3: Add the old name with the apostrophe as an alias:
i. Understand that the old name should be preserved as an alias
ii. Locate the "aliases" field in the input record: "names.types.aliases"
iii. Visualize adding the old name as an alias: names"[{"lang":null,"types":["aliases"],"value":"Al-Balqa Applied University"}]
iv. Encode the addition: alias.add==Al-Balqa' Applied University

Task 4: Add the new ISNI ID to the record:
i. Identify the new ISNI ID from the description: 0000 0123 4789 1232
ii. Locate the "ISNI" field in the input record and note that isni already exists in the field: "external_ids":[{"all":["0000 0004 0623 1491"],"preferred":null,"type":"isni"}]
iii. Visualize adding the new isni ID to the "all" list: ["0000 0004 0623 1491", "0000 0123 4789 1232"]
iv. Encode the addition: isni.add==0000 0123 4789 1232

Task 5: Identify ambiguous changes in the request:
i. Identify that the text, "There's a relationship to the University of Michigan as well. It's link is umich.edu" as ambiguous, as it is unclear what specific changes should be made in reference to the record.
ii. Do not proceed with making these changes, as it is unclear how they relate to the record.
iii. Create a note that describes the ambiguity: This update requests references a change to the relationships that is ambiguous. Please review.

Task 6: Combine the update encoding and the note:
i. Combine the encoded changes from steps 1-4: ror_display.replace==Al-Balqa Applied University | label.delete==Al-Balqa' Applied University | alias.add==Al-Balqa' Applied University | isni.add==0000 0123 4789 1232 | relationships.add==https://ror.org/00jmfr291 | IDRef.add==j123t
ii. Verify that the encoded changes do not violate any of the outline rules. Remove any values from the encoding that violate these rules: Delete relationships.add==https://ror.org/00jmfr291 from the encoding. Delete IDRef.add==j123t from the econding.
ii. Add the note from step 4: Note: This update requests a change to the relationships. Please review.
iii. Terminate the encoding with a "$" symbol

And encode the record as follows: Update: ror_display.replace==Al-Balqa Applied University | label.delete==Al-Balqa' Applied University | alias.add==Al-Balqa' Applied University | isni.add==0000 0123 4789 1232$

You would then respond using the below format:
Update: ror_display.replace==Al-Balqa Applied University | label.delete==Al-Balqa' Applied University | alias.add==Al-Balqa' Applied University | isni.add==0000 0123 4789 1232$
Note: This update requests a change to the relationships. Please review.

"Note" is used for cases where an ambiguous change is requested. It is not necessary to add a note when the changes are explicit the request and have all been encoded without complication.

Now, identify the tasks and provide the encoding for below record and description of change. Respond in the below format. Verify that you respond in this format. Verify that your response conforms to all the rules listed above. Do not include any of your tasks in the response.
Update: [update encoding]$

Add a note using the following format, Note: [note] if necessary.
